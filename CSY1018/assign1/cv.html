<h2>Coursework Year 1</h2>
<p>Whilst in sixth form, I studied Applied IT. There was a lot of coursework I
  completed, which covered a range of skills such as web development (using
  Adobe Dreamweaver), here I learnt how to structure webpages which involved
  HTML code. My website I developed involved information covering E-commerce,
  the digital age, and Internet security. I felt this was able to broaden my
  knowledge about IT overall. For my course I also covered Microsoft Excel using
  formulae and spreadsheets. This involved a 2hr exam in developing an excel
  document for a client. Furthermore I learnt an introduction to databases using
  Microsoft Access. </p>
<p>Now in my year 1 at university, I am studying general computing; therefore
  I am covering a wide range of topics including computer systems,
  communications, software engineering, programming and many more. For three
  out of the six topics I’m currently working on, I have assignments. In
  software engineering we have a group assignment of developing a range of
  software for a client including a kiosk solution, a website and a records
  management system. In programming we have been set an individual assignment
  of writing Java to develop a game from the given materials. And finally in
  web development we are developing our own portfolios via HTML coding. </p>
<p>For the remaining topics, I am revising for time-controlled assessments (TCA)
  , whereby my knowledge will be tested in the chosen areas. In computer systems
  I will be assessed on binary, logic gates and Boolean algebra. For the
  databases topic I will be given a scenario and my knowledge of good practice
  will be evaluated. Last but not least for the computer communications topic, I
  will have to have a good understanding of the TCP/IP layer protocols. </p>
<p>As I have not yet chosen a specialist subject to take my degree in, and so I
  believe all of the skills and information I am learning currently is relevant
  to developing a good basis of understanding for any future career I may peruse
  .</p>
<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>
  As a student I do not currently have a wide range of professional industry
  experience, however I have recently been involved in writing the HTML code to
  create a static form for Fortec Motorsport HR department. Their administration
  team wanted a computerised version of their appraisal forms for their staff to
  fill out and send to management. I am currently developing this in Atom and
  will soon be sending the code over to them to implement into their web-based
  system.
